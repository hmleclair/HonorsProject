##Hailey LeClair's Honors Project CS4900

##Description
This Project uses Python, Keras, and Tensorflow to build and classify images of dresses and shoes, and also
makes an attempt at image matching. 
Using a neural network with a pretrained set of weights (VGG16 -  good explanation here http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frossard/post/vgg16/))
to classify an image in a category of either a dress or shoe, and once it knows that, classify that dress as either a 'long dress'
or a 'puffy dress' or that shoe as a 'sneaker' or a 'high heel'. Once it knows this is will try to match the image with one of the 5 test 
for that category (just to try image matching).
